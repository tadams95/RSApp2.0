# Shopify API Error Boundaries Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of error boundaries for Shopify API operations in the Rage State app. These error boundaries provide robust error handling for product fetching, cart operations, and checkout/payment processing without breaking the user experience.

## Implemented Error Boundaries

### 1. ShopifyErrorBoundary (Base Component)

- **File**: `src/components/shopify/ShopifyErrorBoundary.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Generic error boundary for general Shopify service errors
- **Features**:
  - Customizable fallback UI
  - Error logging integration
  - Context-aware error messages
  - Recovery options with retry functionality
  - Support for custom error handlers

### 2. ProductFetchErrorBoundary

- **File**: `src/components/shopify/ProductFetchErrorBoundary.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Handles errors during product fetching operations
- **Features**:
  - Network error detection and handling
  - Rate limit error handling
  - Product not found error handling
  - Shopify service unavailability handling
  - Context-specific error messages
  - Optional callback for product not found scenarios

### 3. CartOperationErrorBoundary

- **File**: `src/components/shopify/CartOperationErrorBoundary.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Handles errors during cart operations (add/remove/update items)
- **Features**:
  - Cart synchronization error handling
  - Inventory conflict handling
  - Network error recovery
  - User-friendly retry mechanisms
  - Cart state preservation on recoverable errors

### 4. CheckoutPaymentErrorBoundary

- **File**: `src/components/shopify/CheckoutPaymentErrorBoundary.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Handles errors during checkout and payment processing
- **Features**:
  - Payment processing error handling
  - Stripe integration error handling
  - Address validation error handling
  - Order creation failure handling
  - Secure error logging (no sensitive data)

## Integration Points

### Shop Pages

- **Authenticated Shop** (`src/app/(app)/shop/index.tsx`):

  - Wrapped main product listing with `ProductFetchErrorBoundary`
  - Handles product fetching failures gracefully

- **Guest Shop** (`src/app/(guest)/shop/index.tsx`):
  - Wrapped main product listing with `ProductFetchErrorBoundary`
  - Provides fallback UI for unauthenticated users

### Product Detail Pages

- **Authenticated Product Detail** (`src/app/(app)/shop/ProductDetail.tsx`):

  - Wrapped entire component with `ProductFetchErrorBoundary`
  - Wrapped "Add to Cart" button with `CartOperationErrorBoundary`
  - Includes product not found handling with navigation back to shop

- **Guest Product Detail** (`src/app/(guest)/shop/[id].tsx`):
  - Wrapped entire component with `ProductFetchErrorBoundary`
  - Handles product loading errors for guest users

### Cart Page

- **Cart Screen** (`src/app/(app)/cart/index.tsx`):
  - Wrapped "Remove from Cart" buttons with `CartOperationErrorBoundary`
  - Wrapped "Clear Cart" button with `CartOperationErrorBoundary`
  - Wrapped checkout button with `CheckoutPaymentErrorBoundary`
  - Comprehensive error handling for all cart operations

## Error Handling Strategies

### Network Errors

- Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Network connectivity checks
- User-friendly retry buttons
- Offline mode indicators

### API Rate Limiting

- Graceful degradation with retry after delays
- User notification of high traffic conditions
- Automatic retry scheduling

### Product Availability

- Real-time inventory checking
- Out-of-stock handling
- Product removal notifications

### Payment Errors

- Secure error logging (no sensitive payment data)
- Clear user guidance for payment issues
- Integration with existing payment error handlers
- Fallback to alternative payment methods

## User Experience Features

### Fallback UIs

- Context-specific error messages
- Branded error screens consistent with app design
- Clear action buttons (retry, go back, contact support)
- Loading states during error recovery

### Recovery Options

- One-click retry functionality
- Navigation to alternative flows
- Contact support integration
- Cart state preservation where possible

### Error Prevention

- Input validation before API calls
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback
- Conflict detection and resolution
- State synchronization checks

## Technical Implementation Details

### Error Boundary Pattern

- React Error Boundary lifecycle methods
- Error state management
- Component isolation
- Error propagation control

### Error Classification

- Network vs. API errors
- Temporary vs. permanent failures
- User-actionable vs. system errors
- Critical vs. non-critical operations

### Error Logging

- Centralized error logging via `logError` utility
- Error context preservation
- User privacy protection
- Debug information collection

### State Management

- Error boundary state isolation
- Component state preservation
- Redux state consistency
- Error recovery coordination

## Testing Considerations

### Error Simulation

- Network failure simulation
- API timeout testing
- Rate limit testing
- Payment failure scenarios

### User Flow Testing

- Error recovery flows
- Retry mechanisms
- Navigation after errors
- State consistency after recovery

### Accessibility

- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- Focus management during errors
- Clear error announcements

## Benefits

### Improved User Experience

- No app crashes from Shopify API failures
- Clear error communication
- Simple recovery mechanisms
- Maintained shopping flow continuity

### Enhanced Reliability

- Graceful degradation under load
- Robust error handling
- Consistent user experience
- Reduced support requests

### Developer Experience

- Centralized error handling
- Consistent error patterns
- Easy error boundary reuse
- Clear error debugging

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features

- Error analytics and reporting
- Machine learning for error prediction
- Advanced retry strategies
- Circuit breaker patterns

### User Experience

- Progressive error recovery
- Smart error suggestions
- Context-aware help content
- Error feedback collection
