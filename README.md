## Installation
The easiest way to get this up and running is to clone the repository into VSCode.
Run `npm install` to download necessary packages.

See docs.expo.dev for how to get up and running with an Expo Managed App.

## Usage
Shopify, Stripe and Firebase all require special credentials to work correctly.
Make sure you have your own to work properly.

You'll either need physical devices or virtual emulators to run this code.
If you have experience with Expo, you should get it to work.

Then run `npm start` 

## Troubleshooting
Struggle, figure out what's broken, fix it, repeat.
