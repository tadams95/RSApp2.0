- Route "./(app)/cart/transactionConflictHandling.ts" is missing the required default export.
- Route "./(app)/cart/utils/cartErrorHandler.ts" is missing the required default export.
- Route "./(app)/cart/utils/cartPersistence.ts" is missing the required default export.
- Route "./(app)/cart/utils/cartValidation.ts" is missing the required default export.

- Route "./(app)/cart/utils/transactionConflictDetection.ts" is missing the required default export.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
===================

According to Expo Router documentation (Rule #5): "Non-navigation components live outside of app directory"

Files moved:
- src/app/(app)/cart/hooks/useTransactionConflict.ts → src/hooks/cart/useTransactionConflict.ts
- src/app/(app)/cart/utils/* → src/utils/cart/*
- src/app/(app)/cart/transactionConflictHandling.ts → src/utils/cart/transactionConflictHandling.ts

All import statements in affected files have been updated to reference the new locations.

The app now builds successfully without any Expo Router warnings related to missing default exports.
