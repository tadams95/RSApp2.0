## Firebase Initialization

Initial setup of Firebase services can fail in various ways, particularly on app startup.

- [ ] **Connection Failure Handling**:
 
  - [ ] Add offline detection and fallback behavior
  - [ ] Create user-friendly error messages for initialization failures

- [ ] **Configuration Errors**:

  - [ ] Add validation for Firebase config properties
  - [ ] Handle missing API keys or invalid configuration
  - [ ] Provide clear developer logs for misconfiguration

- [ ] **Module Loading Failures**:
  - [ ] Create fallbacks for Firebase module loading failures
  - [ ] Add graceful degradation for optional Firebase features

## Authentication Error Handling

Authentication errors are among the most common user-facing issues in Firebase apps.

- [ ] **Sign Up Errors**:

  - [x] Handle "email already in use" errors in `/src/app/(auth)/signup.tsx`
  - [ ] Add better validation for weak passwords with specific guidance
  - [ ] Create intuitive error UIs for Firebase auth rejections

- [ ] **Login Errors**:

  - [x] Handle "wrong password" and "user not found" in `/src/app/(auth)/login.tsx`
  - [ ] Add account lockout detection and guidance
  - [ ] Implement password reset suggestions for repeated failures

- [ ] **Session Errors**:

  - [ ] Handle token expiration in `/src/hooks/AuthContext.tsx`
  - [ ] Add automatic token refresh mechanism
  - [ ] Handle revoked credentials and force logout scenarios
  - [ ] Create session timeout notifications

- [ ] **Password Reset Errors**:
  - [ ] Handle "user not found" for password reset attempts
  - [ ] Add validation for reset code expiration
  - [ ] Implement clear user guidance for recovery steps

## Firestore Data Operations

Firestore operations can fail due to network issues, permissions, or data constraints.

- [ ] **Read Operation Errors**:

  - [ ] Handle document not found errors in `/src/app/(app)/events/[id].tsx`
  - [ ] Create fallbacks for missing data in event listings
  - [ ] Add error handling for collection queries in `/src/components/modals/MyEvents.tsx`
  - [ ] Implement error boundaries for components dependent on Firestore data

- [ ] **Write Operation Errors**:

  - [ ] Handle permission denied errors for document creation
  - [ ] Add validation before write operations to prevent schema errors
  - [ ] Implement retry mechanisms for failed writes in `/src/app/(app)/cart/index.tsx`

- [ ] **Transaction Failures**:

  - [ ] Add robust error handling for multi-document transactions
  - [ ] Implement rollback mechanisms for failed order processing
  - [ ] Create consistent error messages for transaction conflicts

- [ ] **Pagination Errors**:
  - [ ] Handle cursor errors in paginated queries
  - [ ] Add error handling for out-of-bounds pagination requests
  - [ ] Implement recovery mechanisms for interrupted pagination

## Realtime Database Operations

Realtime Database operations have distinct error patterns from Firestore.

- [ ] **Connection State Handling**:

  - [ ] Monitor and react to Realtime Database connection state changes
  - [ ] Add reconnection logic after connection drops
  - [ ] Implement offline capabilities where appropriate

- [ ] **Data Synchronization Errors**:

  - [ ] Handle sync failures in user profile data
  - [ ] Add conflict resolution strategies for concurrent updates
  - [ ] Create retry mechanisms for failed synchronization

- [ ] **Validation Failures**:
  - [ ] Handle server-side validation rejections
  - [ ] Add client-side validation to match server rules
  - [ ] Provide user feedback for validation failures
  - [ ] Update client data models to prevent invalid operations

## Firebase Storage

Image and file operations have specific error patterns that need handling.

- [ ] **Upload Errors**:

  - [ ] Add proper error handling for profile picture upload in `/src/app/(app)/account/index.tsx`
  - [ ] Handle storage quota exceeded errors
  - [ ] Implement upload progress and error feedback
  - [ ] Add retry mechanisms for failed uploads

- [ ] **Download Errors**:

  - [ ] Enhance profile picture loading with error handling
  - [ ] Add fallbacks for failed image loads in event displays
  - [ ] Implement proper caching and expiration handling for storage URLs
  - [ ] Create user feedback for download failures

- [ ] **File Access Errors**:
  - [ ] Handle "not found" errors for deleted resources
  - [ ] Add permission denied handling for protected resources
  - [ ] Implement graceful UI fallbacks for missing assets

## Firebase Functions

Cloud Functions integration has its own error patterns.

- [ ] **Function Call Errors**:

  - [ ] Add error handling for Stripe customer creation in `/src/app/(auth)/signup.tsx`
  - [ ] Implement timeouts for long-running function calls
  - [ ] Create retry mechanisms for transient function failures

- [ ] **Function Result Validation**:

  - [ ] Add validation for function return data
  - [ ] Implement fallbacks for malformed responses
  - [ ] Create typed interfaces for function results to catch errors early

- [ ] **Rate Limiting and Quotas**:
  - [ ] Add detection and handling for function rate limiting
  - [ ] Implement exponential backoff for quota exceeded errors
  - [ ] Create user feedback for rate-limited operations

## Network and Connectivity Issues

Firebase operations are particularly sensitive to network conditions.

- [ ] **Offline Mode Support**:

  - [ ] Implement Firebase offline persistence configuration
  - [ ] Add user indicators for offline operation mode
  - [ ] Create sync indicators for pending writes
  - [ ] Implement background sync for queued operations

- [ ] **Connection Quality Issues**:

  - [ ] Add timeout handling for slow connections
  - [ ] Implement reduced data requests for poor connections
  - [ ] Create connection quality indicators for users

- [ ] **Recovery Mechanisms**:
  - [ ] Add automatic retry logic for operations after reconnection
  - [ ] Implement data reconciliation for offline changes
  - [ ] Create conflict resolution strategies

## Security and Permission Errors

Security rules violations often lead to cryptic errors for users.

- [ ] **Authentication State Errors**:

  - [ ] Handle unauthenticated access attempts gracefully
  - [ ] Add clear guidance for login requirements
  - [ ] Implement permission-aware UI that prevents unauthorized actions

- [ ] **Permission Denied Handling**:

  - [ ] Create user-friendly messages for permission denied errors
  - [ ] Add proper error handling in `/src/app/(app)/account/index.tsx` for document access
  - [ ] Implement role-based UI adaptation

- [ ] **Security Rules Debugging**:
  - [ ] Add detailed logging for security rule rejections in development
  - [ ] Create developer tools for rules simulation
  - [ ] Implement consistent security error translation for users

## Implementation Strategy

A systematic approach to implementing these error handling improvements:

### Phase 1: Foundation (High Priority)

- [ ] Enhance Firebase initialization error handling in `/src/firebase/firebase.tsx`
- [ ] Complete authentication error handling in existing auth flows
- [ ] Implement basic offline detection and user feedback
- [ ] Add critical data operation error handling in cart checkout and payment flows

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for Firestore operations in events and shop
- [ ] Implement Storage error handling for profile pictures and event images
- [ ] Enhance Functions error handling for payment and user management
- [ ] Create consistent error reporting and logging system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Lower Priority)

- [ ] Implement sophisticated offline mode capabilities
- [ ] Add conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- [ ] Create advanced retry strategies with exponential backoff
- [ ] Implement analytics for error frequency and patterns

### Reusable Components

- [ ] Create a `FirebaseErrorBoundary` component specialized for Firebase operations
- [ ] Develop a `useFirebaseError` custom hook for standardized error handling
- [ ] Implement reusable error UI components specific to common Firebase error patterns
- [ ] Create a Firebase error code to user message mapping utility

### Testing Strategy

- [ ] Create automated tests for error scenarios
- [ ] Implement network condition simulation for testing offline behavior
- [ ] Add permission testing for security rules validation
- [ ] Create a comprehensive error catalog for QA reference
