  email: "user@example.com",
  plan: "premium",
});
```

## 📁 **Analytics Hooks Available**

Use the pre-built hooks in `/src/analytics/analyticsHooks.ts`:

```typescript
import {
  useProductAnalytics,
  useCartAnalytics,
  usePurchaseAnalytics,
  useEventAnalytics,
  useErrorAnalytics,
} from "../analytics/analyticsHooks";

// Track product views, cart actions, purchases, events, and errors
```

## 🐛 **Debugging**

### **Check Console Logs**

In development, PostHog debug mode is enabled. You'll see:

- `PostHog enhancements initialized successfully`
- Event tracking confirmations
- Network status and offline event sync

### **Verify Events**

1. Open your PostHog dashboard
2. Go to "Live Events"
3. Watch events appear in real-time as you use the app

### **Test Offline Functionality**

1. Turn off internet on your device
2. Use the app (events will be queued)
3. Turn internet back on
4. See queued events sync to PostHog

## 🎯 **Next Steps - Add More Tracking**

1. **Product Analytics**: Track product views, searches, favorites
2. **E-commerce**: Track cart operations, purchases, checkout flow
3. **Events**: Track event registrations, views, interactions
4. **User Behavior**: Track app usage patterns, feature adoption

### **Example: Add Product Tracking**

```typescript
// In a product screen
const { trackProductView } = useProductAnalytics();

useEffect(() => {
  trackProductView(product);
}, [product]);
```
