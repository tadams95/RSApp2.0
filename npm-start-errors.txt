/* 
RESOLUTION PLAN FOR NPM START ERRORS:

1. Asset Resolution Issue:
   - Problem: Unable to resolve asset "./assets/RSLogo2025.png" from "icon" in app.json
   - Fix: Verify that the RSLogo2025.png exists in the src/assets directory. The correct path should be "./src/assets/RSLogo2025.png" in app.json

2. Missing Default Exports:
   - Problem: Multiple route files are missing required default exports
   - Fix: Ensure all route files export a default React component as recommended by expo-router
   - Files to update:
     - src/app/(app)/_layout.tsx (already has default export but something is wrong)
     - src/app/(app)/account/index.tsx
     - src/app/(app)/events/index.tsx
     - src/app/(app)/home/index.tsx
     - src/app/(auth)/_exports.tsx
     - src/app/(auth)/_layout.tsx (already has default export but something is wrong)
     - src/app/(auth)/forgotPassword.tsx
     - src/app/(auth)/login.tsx
     - src/app/(auth)/signup.tsx
     - src/app/_layout.tsx

3. "Component auth has not been registered yet" Errors:
   - Problem: It appears the auth component is not properly registered with React Navigation
   - Fix: Update the export name in auth layout files to match the route group name
   - Files to update:
     - src/app/(auth)/_layout.tsx - Ensure export statements use correct naming

4. Shopify API version warning:
   - Problem: Current apiVersion ("2023-10") is deprecated
   - Fix: Update to a supported version (2024-07, 2024-10, 2025-01, 2025-04, 2025-07)
   - Files to update: Locate Shopify client initialization in services/shopifyService.tsx
