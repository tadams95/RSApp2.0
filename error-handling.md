## Implementation Status Summary

### Overall Progress:

- **Error Boundaries**: 90% complete - Core architecture in place including implementation in critical cart and payment containers
- **Error UI Components**: 100% complete - Comprehensive component system implemented
- **API Error Handling**: 80% complete - Core utilities created with implementation in payment services
- **Form Validation**: 90% complete - Added robust validation for all major forms including profile updates
- **Network Error Handling**: 90% complete - Advanced detection with connectivity monitoring and retry mechanisms
- **Firebase Error Handling**: 70% complete - Auth errors well handled, RTDB operations for profile management added, but Firestore operations still need improvement
- **Navigation Errors**: 30% complete - Basic protection with Error Boundaries but specific handling needed
- **Asset Loading Errors**: 90% complete - Added fallbacks for product images and profile images using the new ImageWithFallback component
- **Form Submission Errors**: 90% complete - Robust handling in authentication and cart/payment flows

### Recommendations:

1. **Focus on high-impact areas first**: Cart checkout flow, payment processing, and authentication are critical paths that need robust error handling.
2. **Add global network monitoring**: This will benefit all areas of the app and improve overall user experience.
3. **Add image error fallbacks**: âœ“ Implemented with `ImageWithFallback` component for product and profile images.
4. **Document error handling patterns**: Create a guide for consistent error handling implementation across the team.

### Success Metrics:

Once fully implemented, these error handling improvements should result in:

- Reduced app crashes by >90%
- Improved user retention during network interruptions
- Higher conversion rates on payment flows
- Better user feedback when issues occur
