# Cart Recovery and Error Handling Implementation

This document provides an overview of the cart recovery and error handling implementation for the Rage State app's cart checkout flow.

## Features Implemented

1. **Cart State Persistence**

   - Save cart state before checkout
   - Restore cart state on app restart after payment failure
   - Auto-clear cart state on successful checkout

2. **Payment Error Tracking**

   - Save payment errors with timestamps
   - Detect and handle network-related payment errors
   - Provide user-friendly error messages for different error scenarios

3. **Recovery Flow**

   - Detect recoverable cart state on app startup
   - Show recovery UI to restore previous cart items
   - Implement retry flow for failed payments

4. **Network Resilience**
   - Check network connectivity before payment attempts
   - Implement retry with exponential backoff for network errors
   - Graceful handling of network issues during checkout

## Implementation Details

### Utility Functions

#### Cart Persistence (`cartPersistence.ts`)

- `saveCartState` - Saves cart state to AsyncStorage with timestamp
- `getCartState` - Retrieves saved cart state
- `clearCartState` - Clears saved cart state
- `saveCheckoutError` - Saves payment error information
- `getLastCheckoutError` - Retrieves last saved payment error
- `clearCheckoutError` - Clears saved payment error information
- `isCartRecoverable` - Checks if there is a recoverable cart state
- `hasRecentCheckoutError` - Checks if there was a recent payment error

#### Network Error Detection (`networkErrorDetection.ts`)

- `isNetworkConnected` - Checks if device has network connectivity
- `isNetworkError` - Detects if an error is network-related
- `retryWithBackoff` - Implements exponential backoff retry for network operations

### UI Components

#### Cart Recovery Modal (`CartRecoveryModal.tsx`)

- Shows recovered cart items with timestamp
- Provides options to restore or dismiss the cart

#### Payment Error Handler (`PaymentErrorHandler.tsx`)

- Shows payment error details
- Provides options to retry or cancel the payment

### Workflow Implementation

1. **Before Checkout**

   - Cart state is saved to AsyncStorage
   - Network connectivity is checked

2. **During Payment Processing**

   - Network errors are detected and handled
   - Payment errors are saved with context information

3. **After Payment Failure**

   - On next app start, recoverable cart state is detected
   - User is prompted to restore previous cart or start fresh

4. **On Successful Payment**
   - Cart state and error information are cleared
   - Redux store is updated to reflect successful checkout

## Testing

A testing utility (`testCartRecovery.ts`) has been implemented to test the cart recovery flow:

- `setupTestCartRecovery` - Creates a sample cart for testing recovery
- `setupTestPaymentError` - Creates a sample payment error
- `checkRecoveryState` - Shows current recovery state information
- `simulateAppRestart` - Simulates app restart to test recovery flow
- `debugStorageKeys` - Lists all AsyncStorage keys for debugging
- `clearTestData` - Clears all test data from storage

A development-only testing UI (`CartRecoveryTester.tsx`) is available in the cart screen for convenient testing.

## Future Improvements

1. **Analytics**: Add analytics tracking for recovery attempts and success rates
2. **Multi-device Sync**: Synchronize cart recovery across multiple user devices
3. **Offline Mode**: Enhance checkout to work in fully offline mode with sync when online
4. **Recovery Expiration**: Implement time-based expiration for recoverable cart states
5. **User Notifications**: Add push notifications for failed payment recovery options

## Usage Guidelines

### Handling Payment API Errors

When adding new payment processing features:

1. Always save cart state before initiating payment
2. Use `retryWithBackoff` for network-sensitive API calls
3. Save specific error information using `saveCheckoutError`
4. Implement appropriate user feedback for different error scenarios

### Testing Implementation

Before deploying changes:

1. Test cart recovery using the testing utility
2. Verify recovery works across app restarts
3. Test with network connection toggled off during payment
4. Verify that recovery UI appears correctly with saved cart items
5. Confirm successful checkout clears all recovery data

## Troubleshooting

If cart recovery is not working as expected:

1. Check AsyncStorage keys with `debugStorageKeys`
2. Verify timestamp-based expiration is working correctly
3. Ensure Redux store is correctly updated after recovery
4. Verify that cart state is saved before payment initiation
5. Check error handling in API call functions
