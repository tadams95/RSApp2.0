# Cart Checkout Error Handling

This document outlines the implementation of robust error handling for the cart checkout process in the Rage State app.

## Implementation Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive error handling system for the cart checkout process with the following features:

1. **Cart Validation**
   - Field-level validation for cart items (size, color, quantity)
   - Visual indicators for validation errors
   - User-friendly error messages

2. **Network Error Handling**
   - Network connectivity checks before checkout
   - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Recovery options for failed network requests

3. **Transaction Error Handling**
   - Transaction wrapper with retry capability
   - Logging for failed transactions
   - User-friendly error messages for transaction failures

4. **Order Creation Resilience**
   - Idempotent order creation to prevent duplicates
   - Order state persistence for recovery
   - Order reconciliation checks to verify if orders were created

## Key Components

### Cart Validation (`cartValidation.ts`)
- Validates cart items before checkout
- Provides field-level error reporting
- Returns user-friendly error messages

### Network Error Detection (`networkErrorDetection.ts`)
- Checks network connectivity
- Identifies network-related errors
- Implements retry with exponential backoff

### Transaction Handling (`firestoreTransaction.ts`)
- Provides a retry wrapper for Firestore transactions
- Translates cryptic Firestore errors to user-friendly messages
- Logs transaction errors for debugging

### Order Idempotency (`orderIdempotency.ts`)
- Creates orders idempotently to prevent duplicates
- Reconciles orders when errors occur
- Recovers from failed order creation attempts

### Cart Persistence (`cartPersistence.ts`)
- Saves cart state for potential recovery
- Persists error information
- Checks for recoverable carts

## Error Handling Flow

1. Before checkout, cart validation is performed
2. Network connectivity is checked
3. Cart state is saved for potential recovery
4. During order creation, idempotency checks prevent duplicates
5. If an error occurs, reconciliation checks verify if the order was actually created
6. On app start, recovery checks look for interrupted checkout sessions

## Recovery Process

1. When the app starts, it checks for interrupted checkout sessions
2. If a previous checkout error is found, it attempts to reconcile the order
3. If an order is found, the user is notified and the cart is cleared
4. If no order is found, the user can restore their cart and try again

## Future Improvements

1. Add analytics to track types of checkout failures
2. Implement more detailed error reporting for specific product types
3. Add automatic reconciliation for payment intent status
4. Enhance the recovery UI with more detailed information
