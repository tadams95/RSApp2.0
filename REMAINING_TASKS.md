## PRIORITY 1: User Profile MVP (Social Foundation) 🎯 **CRITICAL**

### 1.1 Enhanced User Profile Data Model

**Current State**: Basic user profiles exist but lack social features and consistent viewing patterns

**Strategic Importance**: **HIGHEST** - Foundation for all community features

**MVP Enhancement Approach**:

- [ ] **Extend Existing UserData Interface**

  - [ ] Add social fields to `src/utils/auth.ts` UserData interface:
    - `bio?: string` (max 160 chars)
    - `socialLinks?: { soundcloud?: string, instagram?: string, twitter?: string }`
    - `interests?: string[]` (music genres, event types)
    - `location?: { city?: string, state?: string, country?: string }` (for geographic discovery)
    - `isPublic?: boolean` (profile visibility)
    - `searchable?: boolean` (appears in search results)
    - `lastActive?: string` (for activity status)
    - `verificationStatus?: 'none' | 'verified' | 'artist'`
    - `joinedDate?: string` (account creation for profile display)
    - `stats?: { eventsAttended: number, postsCount: number, profileViews: number }`

- [ ] **Leverage Existing Profile Infrastructure**
  - [ ] Use existing `useProfileSync` hook for real-time profile updates
  - [ ] Extend `EditProfile.tsx` modal to include bio and social links
  - [ ] Use existing image compression system for profile pictures
  - [ ] Leverage current PostHog analytics for profile view tracking

### 1.2 User Profile View Component

**Implementation Strategy**: Create reusable profile component that works for both self and other users

- [ ] **Core Profile View Component**

  - [ ] Create `src/components/profile/UserProfileView.tsx` with two modes:
    - **Self Mode**: Shows "Edit Profile" button, private stats, full access
    - **Other User Mode**: Shows "Follow" button, public info only, interaction options
  - [ ] Implement profile header with:
    - Profile picture (using existing ImageWithFallback pattern)
    - Display name and verification badge
    - Bio section with expandable text
    - Joined date and last active status
    - Public stats (events attended, posts)

- [ ] **Social Interaction Elements**
  - [ ] Follow/Unfollow button (MVP: UI only, function placeholder for social feed phase)
  - [ ] Social links (SoundCloud, Instagram, Twitter) with external opening
  - [ ] Interest tags display (music genres, event preferences)
  - [ ] Recent activity section (events attended, upcoming events)

### 1.3 Profile Navigation & Routing

**Leverage Existing Expo Router Structure**:

- [ ] **New Profile Routes**

  - [ ] Create `src/app/(app)/profile/[userId].tsx` for viewing other users
  - [ ] Create `src/app/(app)/search/index.tsx` for user search/discovery
  - [ ] Keep existing `src/app/(app)/account/index.tsx` for self-profile
  - [ ] Add profile navigation helper: `navigateToProfile(userId)` utility

  - [ ] Add search filters: location, interests, verification status
  - [ ] Create "Recent Searches" and "Suggested Users" sections

- [ ] **Search Backend & Data**

  - [ ] Create Firestore compound indexes for user search:
    - `displayName + isPublic + lastActive`
    - `interests + isPublic + lastActive`
    - `location + isPublic + lastActive`
  - [ ] Implement search service in `src/services/userSearch.ts`
  - [ ] Add fuzzy search for display names (handle typos)
  - [ ] Create search result ranking algorithm (activity, mutual connections, interests)

- [ ] **Search Analytics**

  - [ ] Extend existing analytics with user search tracking:
    - `user_search_performed` (query, results count, filters used)
    - `user_search_result_clicked` (clicked user ID, search query, position in results)
    - `user_search_no_results` (query that returned no results)
    - `user_discovery_method` (search vs suggestions vs mutual friends)

- [ ] **Discovery Features**
