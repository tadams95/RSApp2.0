# RAGE STATE APP - REMAINING CRITICAL TASKS

_Engineering Manager's Consolidated Working Document_

## Overview

The Rage State app has successfully migrated to Expo Router with TypeScript. This document contains only the **critical remaining tasks** to complete the modernization and remove technical debt.

## PRIORITY 1: Remove Technical Debt (URGENT)

### 1.1 Remove Legacy React Navigation Dependencies ✅

**Issue**: Package.json contained legacy React Navigation packages that conflict with Expo Router

**Actions**:

- [x] Remove these packages: `npm uninstall @react-navigation/bottom-tabs @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack @react-native-masked-view/masked-view`
- [x] Search codebase for any remaining React Navigation imports (none found)
- [x] Test app functionality after removal (TypeScript compilation successful)
- [x] Run `npx expo-doctor` to verify no conflicts (only non-critical icon and package metadata warnings remain)

### 1.2 Clean Up Redundant Documentation Files ✅

**Issue**: Multiple overlapping documentation files causing confusion:

- [x] Remove `implementation-guide.md` (migration complete)
- [x] Remove `implementation-plan.md` (superseded by current state)
- [x] Remove `dependency-update.md` (actions completed)
- [x] Archive `migration-checklist.md` to `docs/` folder (reference only)
- [x] Move other reference docs to `docs/` folder

## PRIORITY 2: Complete Error Handling Implementation

### 2.1 Firebase Storage Error Handling

**Missing implementations**:

- [x] Add `storage/unauthorized` error handling in `SettingsModal.tsx` for profile picture deletion
- [x] Implement storage permission error recovery in event image access components
- [ ] Add storage URL validation error handling

### 2.2 API Error Boundaries

**Missing implementations**:

- [x] **Cart Checkout Flow Error Boundaries**:

  - [x] Add error boundary around `CheckoutTransactionHandler.tsx` component
  - [x] Implement error boundary for `PaymentErrorHandler.tsx` to catch unhandled payment API failures
  - [x] Add error boundary for `CartReconciliationHandler.tsx` inventory sync failures
  - [x] Create error boundary for `TransactionConflictHandler.tsx` to handle checkout conflicts
  - [x] Add fallback UI for complete checkout flow failure with retry mechanism

- [x] **Account Management Error Boundaries**:

  - [x] Add error boundary around `EditProfile.tsx` modal for profile update API failures
  - [x] Implement error boundary for `SettingsModal.tsx` account deletion and admin operations
  - [x] Add error boundary for profile picture upload/delete operations in account screen
  - [x] Create error boundary for user data fetch operations in account screen
  - [x] Add error boundary for profile sync operations using `useProfileSync` hook

- [x] **Shopify API Error Boundaries**:
  - [x] Add error boundary for product fetching failures in shop screens
  - [x] Implement error boundary for cart operations (add/remove/update)
  - [x] Add error boundary for checkout API calls and payment processing
  - [x] Create fallback UI for Shopify service unavailability

### 2.3 Network Error Recovery

**Missing implementations**:

- [ ] Add offline support for critical user actions
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms for failed network requests
- [ ] Add network status indicators in UI

## PRIORITY 3: Performance Optimizations

### 3.1 Virtualized Lists

**Current Issue**: Large product/event lists cause performance issues

- [ ] Implement FlashList for shop product listings
- [ ] Implement FlashList for events listings
- [ ] Add lazy loading for product images
- [ ] Implement pagination for large datasets

### 3.2 Image Optimization

- [ ] Replace Image components with expo-image
- [ ] Add proper image caching strategy
- [ ] Implement progressive image loading
- [ ] Add image compression for uploads

## PRIORITY 4: State Management Optimization

### 4.1 React Query Implementation

**Current Issue**: All server state mixed with client state in Redux

- [ ] Install and configure React Query: `npm install @tanstack/react-query`
- [ ] Create React Query provider in root layout
- [ ] Migrate product fetching to React Query
- [ ] Migrate event fetching to React Query
- [ ] Keep only UI state in Redux (auth, cart, user preferences)

### 4.2 Zustand Migration (OPTIONAL - Future)

**Note**: Consider for future simplification, not critical now

- [ ] Evaluate Zustand for simpler client state management
- [ ] Create migration plan if Redux becomes too complex

## PRIORITY 5: Testing Infrastructure

### 5.1 Basic Testing Setup

**Current Issue**: No testing infrastructure

- [ ] Install testing dependencies: `npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react-native jest-expo`
- [ ] Configure Jest for React Native
- [ ] Add basic tests for utility functions
- [ ] Add component tests for critical UI components
- [ ] Add integration tests for auth flow

### 5.2 E2E Testing (OPTIONAL)

- [ ] Consider Detox for E2E testing of critical user flows

## PRIORITY 6: Analytics Implementation

### 6.1 Firebase Analytics Setup

**Current Issue**: No user behavior tracking

- [ ] Install Firebase Analytics: `npm install @react-native-firebase/analytics`
- [ ] Create analytics provider component
- [ ] Add screen tracking hook
- [ ] Implement event tracking for:
  - Product views
  - Add to cart actions
  - Purchase completions
  - Event ticket purchases

## PRIORITY 7: Styling System (NativeWind)

### 7.1 NativeWind Implementation

**Current Issue**: Inconsistent styling patterns across app

- [ ] Install NativeWind: `npm install nativewind tailwindcss`
- [ ] Configure Tailwind config file
- [ ] Update Babel config for NativeWind
- [ ] Create design system with consistent spacing/colors
- [ ] Migrate core components to NativeWind classes
- [ ] Update theme provider for dark/light mode

## PRIORITY 8: Final Optimizations

### 8.1 Build Optimization

- [ ] Optimize bundle size with Metro config
- [ ] Add code splitting for route-based chunks
- [ ] Optimize asset loading

### 8.2 Security Review

- [ ] Audit Firebase security rules
- [ ] Review sensitive data storage practices
- [ ] Add input validation for all forms
- [ ] Implement rate limiting where needed

## COMPLETED ITEMS (Do Not Work On)

**✅ Migration Complete:**

- Expo Router file-based routing
- TypeScript conversion
- Authentication flow
- Route group layouts
- Package dependency updates (React Native Paper, etc.)
- Basic error handling
- Firebase integration
- Redux state management

## TIMELINE ESTIMATE

- **Priority 1 (Tech Debt)**: 2-3 days
- **Priority 2 (Error Handling)**: 1 week
- **Priority 3 (Performance)**: 1-2 weeks
- **Priority 4 (State Management)**: 1 week
- **Priority 5 (Testing)**: 1-2 weeks
- **Priority 6 (Analytics)**: 3-5 days
- **Priority 7 (Styling)**: 1-2 weeks
- **Priority 8 (Final)**: 3-5 days

**Total Estimated Timeline**: 6-8 weeks

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] App builds without warnings or errors
- [ ] No legacy dependencies remain
- [ ] All critical error scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance meets acceptable standards (< 3s initial load)
- [ ] Basic test coverage > 60%
- [ ] Analytics tracking implemented
- [ ] Consistent styling system in place
